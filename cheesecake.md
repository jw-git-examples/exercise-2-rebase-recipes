Codilime Cheesecake
===================

Ingredients
-----------

2½ lb of unsalted, creamy white cheese
¾ lb of sour cream (18%)
5 big eggs (¾ lb in total)
¼ pound of unsalted butter
1 cup of cane sugar (½ pound)
1 tbsp. vanilla sugar (or some vanilla extract)
1 pack of biscuits
chocolate
whipping cream
shredded coconut (2 ounces? perhaps less)

Procedure
---------

Remove butter from the fridge so that it softens a bit.
Butter the bottom of the baking form and put one layer of biscuits on it.
Separate egg whites from yolks.
Beat yolks with sugar and vanilla sugar, add butter.
Add cheese and mix/beat well (don’t beat too long, though, or the cake won’t be fluffy).
Whip egg whites (it’s best to whip them in a metal bowl), add it to the cheese and mix gently with a big spoon until the foam blends with the cheese completely. Pour into baking form.
Bake for 60-75 minutes in an oven preheated to 300 F (without fan assistance!).
Don’t cool too rapidly.

When the cake has mostly cooled down, you can prepare the chocolate topping:
Put cream in a pot and heat slowly until it is almost boiling.
Add cracked chocolate and mix until it melts.
Pour over the cake.
When the chocolate starts to set, sprinkle it with shredded coconut.

Cool in the refridgerator overnight.
