TODO: check which temperature and baking time works better. Polish version of
the recipe that I've found somewhere calls for different settings than the
English one, and the only way to decide which is better is to try both and
compare the results.

TODO: Mention that chocolate topping can be replaced or combined with lemon
curd (suggested amount: 200g).
