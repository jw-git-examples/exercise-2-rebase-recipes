Git rebase exercise
===================

This is an artificial repository for practicing history rewriting. It is based
on real data from https://github.com/jan-warchol/przepisy-programisty.


Recipes and cooking notes
-------------------------

I like to experiment with recipes, aiming to find the best possible cheesecake,
cookies etc. This is the place where I keep my notes, trying to make them
accurate and reproducible. Hopefully one day this will become a complete
cookbook :)

How to use this
---------------

* each directory is a separate recipe
* the official version of a recipe is in `README.md`
* experiment results and comments are in `notes.md`
